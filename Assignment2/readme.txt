So for the first part, some functions that we would need for an array specifically 
would be push, pop, and peek as discussed in class. This only is applicable for the 
top part of the array however.

For a linked list as discussed in class, you have nodes with data inside, and a pointer with
the memory address of next in line

For the queue, it has things that are pushed in the back enqueue, with dequeue to release the
"things" in question. Deletes the front node, points backwards, and moves towards the back of the line

So the queue I came up with was a rollercoaster queue (I definitely haven't been playing a ton 
of Planet Coaster). The ride only fits two people, so two have to be pushed from the queue.
There is an employee to check (size) of the queue, and the road itself will check for (empty).
The values we need to know for this is if the rider is too young to be on the ride.

For the next list data structure, I designed it as an airplane line. Being that I haven't been
on an airplane since I was 8, I allowed myself some creative freedom. The guard dog is the remove()
function, which allows you to remove from inside the list. The first class line is for putting people
in the line anywhere, which is using insert(). Some values here could be the boarding numbers.

PS: Yes, I was an art major once upon a time, I know its probably easy to tell. You could sell these
for at least a million each.
