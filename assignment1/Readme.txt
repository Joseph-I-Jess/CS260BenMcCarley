What a program COULD do, is much different than what I am capable of now,
I didn't take the 133C class and only have experience with python, and google
helped me suprisingly little. I complained about python but I miss it already.

Most of this will be going off just pure theory since I do not know much about this 
language yet

1. What could represent the marbles could be binary or hexadecimal theoretically, or I could just 
assign numbers to a variable

2/3. The way that I know of that we could add more marbles into the bag could use cin and cout to 
respectively get an input to add or remove and print the number afterwards

4. My code is not smart enough to deal with any of these tests, but some that I would use would be 
removing or taking from an empty bag, or adding very high.

to be honest the program is scrapped together from things I found online, as I said earlier it will be a bit of a hurdle 
to get over to get accquainted with c++, but I will get there hopefully soon
